							  <p>
   								 As someone who watches lots of movies from various different languages,<br>
   								 I get asked a lot of questions about what I think about certain movies.<br>
   								 Sometimes, a movie that gets bad reviews will still be entertaining to me.<br>
   								 The idea behind the project is to compare and contrast different movies,<br>
   								 their gross, budgets, and other data as well as the production companies to<br>
    								 see what factors influence the success of a movie or show and to see what movies<br>
    								 and shows are higly profitable.

							<p><br>Let's start off by talking about one of the most popular TV shows of all time,
							Game of Thrones. Being such a popular show, it is estimated that each episode was
							generating over 215 million dollars of profit. Everyone at my high school would talk 
							about it, but where did it all go wrong? The last season of game of thrones was being 
							bashed and people were saying it ended badly. It was such a drastic turnaround and this
							drastic change can be eaily visualized in this heatmap of ratings for every episode.<br></p>

							<h2>The Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2>
							<p>
							Some of the most liked and profitable movies in modern times have been Marvel movies. They earn a
							ridiculous amount of money, but also cost a ton to produce. Here is a bubble chart that shows correlation
							between the rating, budget, and gross, for all Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies that have been released.</p>
